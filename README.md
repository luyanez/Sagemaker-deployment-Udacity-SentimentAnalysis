# Machine Learning Deployment using AWS SageMaker

## Project
Sentiment Analysis Web App is a notebook and collection of Python files to be completed. 
The result is a deployed RNN performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with 
publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint. 
This project assumes that you have some familiarity with SageMaker. Completing the XGBoost 
Sentiment Analysis notebook should suffice.
